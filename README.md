# Tech++ 
Tech ++ is currently in production phase, since the website incorporates ample amount of backend technologies, and that we are trying to mirror and improvise other student community websites. In a nutshell, Tech ++ -
1. Brings students across the globe together, in a safe and open environment, where each individual is free to share ideas and resources. 
2. The Covid Pandemic has certainly exposed many of us to the realities of job hunting and how one needs to tailor their profile to make it more enticing and amount to the desired levels of finesse. With the aid of Tech++, students can share this information in the form of personal blog posts describing their journey, challenges and preparation methodology to their target insititutions.
With the growing intellectual resources and data within the student community, Tech++ can certainly act as a good hosting point, where one can freely share their work with the larger tribe.
