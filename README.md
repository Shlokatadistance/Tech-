# Tech++ 

So looking at this repository, you might have some questions to ask. I'll exercise my brevity and try and answer them.

Q1. What is Tech++?

Tech ++ is currently in production phase, since the website incorporates ample amount of backend technologies, and that we are trying to mirror and improvise other student community websites. In a nutshell, Tech ++ -

1. Brings students across the globe together, in a safe and open environment, where each individual is free to share ideas and resources. 

2. The Covid Pandemic has certainly exposed many of us to the realities of job hunting and how one needs to tailor their profile to make it more enticing and amount to the desired levels of finesse. With the aid of Tech++, students can share this information in the form of personal blog posts describing their journey, challenges and preparation methodology to their target insititutions.  

3.With the growing intellectual resources and data within the student community, Tech++ can certainly act as a good hosting point, where one can freely share their work with the larger tribe.


Q2. Technology Stack being used?

Tech++ is being built with the MERN Stack.
The frontend is all React, while the backend makes use of Node and Express.

Q3. Why are there no files in the Git Repo?

Tech ++ is currently in production phase, since the website incorporates ample amount of backend technologies, and that I am trying to mirror and improvise other student community websites. I will be pushing out the first set of files shortly.
